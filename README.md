# Mars Markweb Browser

The first Markweb browser!

This browser, made with Python, is a **terminal browser**, meaning that it is meant to be ran within a terminal, but don't let that be the dealbreaker! Mars uses the Textual module, a TUI-making awesome framework that blurs the line between TUI and GUI because of its mouse support.
